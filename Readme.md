This is some really old C++ code to simulate a simple computer.  Back when I wrote
this (circa 1991), I worked on Sparc architectural simulators for Sun Microsystems.
The simulators were in C and had a really complicated mechanism for specifying the
components to be simulated and their interconnections; I was trying to show the team
that it could be done much more simply, like the dozen or so lines in Simulation.cpp.

Unfortunately they didn't know anything about C++ or OOP, and regarded C++ as a shiny
new toy rather than a real option for serious work.  History might be giggling at them
just a little bit.  :)
